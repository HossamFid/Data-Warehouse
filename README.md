# Overview
This project demonstrates the use of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and SQL to build a data warehouse solution using the AdventureWorks database. The AdventureWorks database is a sample dataset provided by Microsoft, which simulates a retail company's transactional data for sales, purchasing, production, and other business activities.

The goal of this project is to develop an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to populate the AdventureWorks Data Warehouse and perform meaningful analysis.

## Features
Data Integration: Extracts data from the AdventureWorks OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) system.
Data Transformation: Cleanses and transforms the extracted data for analysis and reporting.
Data Loading: Populates fact and dimension tables in the data warehouse.
SSIS Packages: Implements ETL workflows using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to automate the data processing
